# algorithms-and-data-structures
This is a series of algorithms I am writing based on Youtube MIT classes in an attempt to improve my algorithmical thinking.
My primary goal by the end of the series is to be able to reliably evauluate the complexity of algorithms (space and time) and write better ones.
My secondary goal is to demonstrate this by writing a basic image compressing algorithm and getting it to work on a small number of unsplash images.
